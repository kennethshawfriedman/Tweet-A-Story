# Tweet-A-Story
A Python Based Twitter Bot to Systematically Post Tweets of a Text File

By Kenneth Shaw Friedman.

First used for [@ksfbookreview](https://twitter.com/ksfbookreview).

## Dependencies
This project requires [Python Twitter Tools](http://mike.verdone.ca/twitter/). It also requires you to set up an app on [dev.twitter.com](http://dev.twitter.com). Once you set up the app (instructions easily found with a quick web search), simply copy the tokens & keys into the .py file.


## Tips
Be careful of Twitter's 100 tweets/hr limit. Setting the wait period to 36 or 37 will ensure you do not run into this problem.

It is very annoying to have to delete tweets from Twitter. I recommend you test the script on your text file with the tweet command removed before running the script that will actually post.

Feel free to post an Issue if you notice any problems or have any trouble. 'Happy tweeting' as they say.
